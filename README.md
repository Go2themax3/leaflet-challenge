# leaflet-challenge
Overview
This project is aimed at creating visualizations for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake data. USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards and develops new methods to supply timely, relevant information about the Earth and its processes. This project will help USGS in representing the vast amount of data they collect in a more meaningful and educative way.

Create the Earthquake Visualization

Set up your project repository as instructed in the "Before You Begin" section.
Download and use the provided Module 15 Challenge files.
Select a USGS GeoJSON dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed for visualization.
Create a map using Leaflet to plot all the earthquakes from your chosen dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
Style your data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
Include popups to provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
Create a legend to provide context for your map data.
